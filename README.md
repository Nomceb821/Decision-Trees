**Identifying Diabetes Risk Factors with Decision Tree Classification for Early Intervention.**
**Introduction**
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, significantly impacting
individuals' quality of life and placing a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Predicting
diabetes early and intervening promptly are essential to preventing complications and enhancing
long-term health outcomes. (Adbullah et al., 2010). Effective prediction models can help
healthcare providers identify at-risk individuals early on and offer a personalized lifestyle. In
recent years, machine learning algorithms have gained a lot of attraction in medical diagnosis
and predictive modeling, offering tools to analyze complex relationships in health data. Among
these, the Decision Tree Classifier is particularly valuable due to its interpretability, which
allows professionals in the health care system to understand the reasoning behind predictions. By
utilizing patient data features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure, a Decision
Tree Classifier can help reveal significant factors contributing to diabetes risk.

This study aims to develop a Decision Tree Classifier model that accurately predicts diabetes
based on selected patient features. Through this model, we seek not only to enhance prediction
accuracy, but also to provide insights into the primary factors associated with diabetes. The goal
is to support healthcare providers in making informed, data-driven recommendations to reduce
the incidence of diabetes and improve patient health outcomes.
